# Kalimbass
Solid body "bass kalimba": hairpins sampled with two Strat pickups (bridge, + middle for noise canceling only).
4 mono samples per octave, each with three plucked dynamic levels plus a set of Sul Pont samples (plucking very close to the mounting point using a guitar pick).

There are two versions of the instrument script: controlled by keyswitches, and controlled by CC10.

The dynamic levels may be selected by velocity (Auto), or one particular dynamic (Soft, Medium, Hard, or Sul Pont) may be locked in by keyswitch (in one version) or CC10 (in the other) so that only volume scales with velocity. 

Includes controls for modulation depth, modulation rate, modulation fade-in, and attack time.
